## Description

This project had been a challenge for a student like me who has never code in their life. I do enjoy the challenges and solving problems during the pre-work. This project motivated me to search for answers and not to be afraid to ask for help when needed. Building this project helped me gain new knowledge about this course and helped build my mentality. I solved a couple of debugs during this assignment. I've learned how to use GitHub, Use command-lines, pull-request, and Git. I learned how to use the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
